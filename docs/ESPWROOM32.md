# Issues while uploading code
While uploading code we get this error on both `Windows / Linux` based machines.

 does not exist or your board is not connected
```

This can be solved by holding the `boot` button on the board for a second or so, the chip is now in download mode and is ready for code upload. Example Output of a successful upload
